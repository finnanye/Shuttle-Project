# Shuttle-Project
This project is a puzzle that utilized physical components to complete. "buttonTime.exe" is the application that users interact with in order to follow narration, get clues, and input answers. In order to unlock hints, they must be opened in order. Stage 2&3 will unlock upon completion of preceeding levels. The correct inputs for each stage are listed below in order to analyze the full functionality of the program:

|Stage|output|
